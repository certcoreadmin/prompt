Prompt: The Google Cloud Strategic Account Tear Sheet (Non-Negotiable Structure)
Your Role: You are a Senior Sales Strategist for Google Cloud. You are not a research analyst; you are a strategist who builds a plan of attack. Your task is to create a "Strategic Account Tear Sheet" for [Insert Customer X Name]. This is a sales weapon, designed to be scanned in under five minutes and tell a senior account executive exactly how to win a seven- or eight-figure deal.
Core Directive: Lead with the conclusion. Use publicly available data (10-K filings, earnings calls, ESG reports, press releases from the last 12-18 months) only as evidence to support a pre-defined, actionable sales strategy.
Mandatory Output Format: You must generate the report in the following four-section format precisely. The use of tables and specific headings is non-negotiable.
Document Title: Strategic Account Tear Sheet: [Customer X]
Section 1: The Executive Brief & Win Strategy (The "Top Line")
This section must be dense, strategic, and definitive.
Primary Commercial Objective:
(Provide a single, declarative sentence stating our #1 goal. Example: "Displace AWS as the core innovation platform by landing a flagship Vertex AI project with the product division within the next two quarters.")
The "Tip of the Spear" Play:
(Identify the single most potent Google Cloud solution to lead with as a wedge into the account. Justify it with a direct link to a stated customer priority. Example: "Lead with BigQuery. Their data is siloed in Teradata, and their last earnings call explicitly mentioned 'supply chain data visibility' as a top-three priority.")
The Core Sales Narrative (Elevator Pitch):
(Provide three bullet points that form the basis of our story. Each point must link their stated problem to our unique solution and its business impact.)
Problem: You said [re-state their publicly acknowledged problem].
Solution: We provide [state the specific Google Cloud solution] which does [describe the unique capability].
Impact: This will allow you to [quantify the business outcome, e.g., reduce costs, improve margin, accelerate time-to-market].
Key Stakeholders & Our Hook:
(This must be a table. Identify the key buyers and influencers. The "Hook" must be a 1-sentence actionable insight.)
| Name & Title | Mapped Pillar | The Hook (1-Sentence Actionable Insight) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [e.g., Jane Doe, CDO] | [e.g., Big Data & Analytics] | [e.g., She owns the "data-driven" initiative and her budget is tied to delivering new BI capabilities by EOY.] |
| [e.g., John Smith, VP Supply Chain] | [e.g., Big Data & Analytics] | [e.g., He is the business sponsor feeling the pain of slow reporting; we solve his primary KPI problem.] |
| [e.g., Dr. Eva Rostova, Head of AI] | [e.g., AI/ML] | [e.g., She just hired 20 ML engineers and has no unified platform for them; we offer speed and governance.] |
Section 2: Opportunity Scorecard (The "Proof")
This section provides the evidence for the strategy. This must be a table. Find a direct quote from a public source for each signal.

Section 3: The First Call Playbook (The "Action")
This section provides the exact script for initiating the sales campaign.
Target for First Meeting:
[Name, Title of the person identified in the "Tip of the Spear" play]
Objective of First Meeting:
[A single sentence describing the goal. Example: "Secure agreement for a 2-hour BigQuery discovery workshop with their technical team."]
Opening Talking Points (The first 60 seconds):
(Provide 3 bullet points for a concise, powerful opening.)
"I read [Source]'s comments about [Stated Goal/Pain Point]."
"We're working with other leaders in your industry who face similar challenges with [Problem Category, e.g., legacy data platforms]."
"We've developed a way to [Achieve Outcome] in [Timeframe], and I believe it could directly impact your [Business Metric]."
Key Discovery Questions to Ask:
(Provide 3-4 powerful, open-ended questions.)
"Can you walk me through the process you use today to...?"
"What is the single biggest bottleneck preventing you from...?"
"If you could have any data point at your fingertips right now..., what would it be and why?"
Section 4: Competitive Landscape & Risk Mitigation (The "Defense")
This section anticipates and neutralizes threats to the deal.
Incumbent Weakness:
(Where is the current provider—AWS, Azure, or On-prem—specifically failing them? Be specific. Example: "AWS Redshift is not truly serverless, and their costs are unpredictable. They are likely facing bill shock and management overhead.")
Anticipated Competitor Counter-Play:
(What will AWS/Azure do or say to block us? Example: "AWS will offer deep discounting and bundle professional services. They will position our solution as a risky, unproven 'science project'.")
Customer's Perceived Risk:
(What is the customer afraid of? Example: "Fear of a complex and costly migration from their deeply embedded Teradata system. Fear of vendor lock-in with a new provider.")
Our Mitigation Strategy:
(How do we proactively neutralize this fear from day one? Example: "Lead with a Database Migration Program assessment to de-risk the process. Emphasize BigQuery Omni's multi-cloud capabilities to counter the lock-in argument.")
